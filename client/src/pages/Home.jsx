        <h3>Star Punter's Season Highlights</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Celebrate the backbone of our team’s success this season with our
            standout punter! Consistency and precision define their performance,
            evident in key victories where their average of 40.2 yards over five
            punts against NC State set the tone for crucial field position.
            Against Clemson, they reached new heights with an impressive
            47.5-yard average over six punts, showcasing both distance and
            accuracy with minimal touchbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their impact continued against JMU, averaging 45.0 yards over three
            punts, proving instrumental in yet another decisive win. Facing
            tough opponents like Wake Forest and Pitt, they maintained their
            high standard, averaging 40.3 yards and 42.8 yards respectively
            across seven punts, ensuring our team consistently controlled the
            field.
          </p>
          <p>
            From flipping field position to executing under pressure, our
            punter's contributions have been invaluable this season, playing a
            pivotal role in our victories.
